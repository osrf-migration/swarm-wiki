# FAQ

1. Will the size of 'world' be known? (I.e., does my robot team know the GPS-coordinates of the search space?)

1. Are there any other features of the environment that can be provided to the robots a-priori?

1. Will there be a fixed base-station with a known location?

1. Will you be providing a model of how GPS and camera (sensing data) are affected by the environment? (So that we can exploit this in our algorithms)

1. The wiki mentions that different configurations of aerial and ground vehicles will be used. Will these configs be given, or do we decide? Also, does 'config' just mean proportion of ground-to-aerial, or are there more parameters that can be tuned? (I remember there was a similar question in the call, but don't recall your answer...)
